# Data Visualization: Charts in pyobsplot

## Learning Outcomes

Learners will acquire the fundamental skills needed to create basic data visualizations using pyobsplot (a Python interface to Observable Plot). Through guided examples and exercises, participants will learn how to generate line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots. They will gain proficiency in customizing these visualizations, including adding labels, titles, and changing styles. Specific outcomes include:

1. Be able to create visualizations using pyobsplot
2. Be able to identify and create different types of plots
3. Be able to change the styles of the plots
4. Be able to encode data attributes through visual channels
5. Be able to visualize data from data frames 
6. Be able to decide which charts are most appropriate for different types of tasks
